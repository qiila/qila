My name is Nur Akilah Binti Che Abdullah, and I am a 20-year-old student currently pursuing my studies in Diploma of Information Management at <abbr title= "Universiti Teknologi MARA" > UiTM</abbr> , Rembau campus. 
I am enrolled in the <abbr title="Pengajian Sains Maklumat, Pengkomputeran, Informatik dan Matematik">PSM,KPPIM</abbr>
As the eighth child out of nine siblings, I come from a large and close-knit family that has always inspired me to strive for excellence.

Growing up in a caring family with many siblings taught me the importance of teamwork, patience, and adaptability.
Despite the difficulties that come with being part of a large family, I've always been encouraged to follow my goals and make the most of my education. 
From a young age, I was an ambitious person who set goals personally and worked hard to attain them. I feel that determination is essential for overcoming hurdles and realizing my best potential.

    As the American author and motivational speaker, <strong>Zig Ziglar</strong>, once said, 
    <em><font color ="teal">“You don’t have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.”</font> </em>
    This quote inspires me to take the first step toward my dreams, no matter how challenging it may seem.
</p>

<p>
    At present, my main ambition is to continue my studies and complete my degree. 
    I am passionate about learning and have a deep interest in the field of Information Management,
    as it offers a perfect blend of technology, data, and organizational skills.
    As I work toward achieving this goal, I always keep in mind the words of the renowned writer, <b>J.K. Rowling:</b>  
    <i><font color =#ab670e >“It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.”</font> </i>
    To me, this quote reflects the courage required to pursue one’s dreams, even in the face of challenges or doubts.
